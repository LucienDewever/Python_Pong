# Python_Pong
A remake of Pong using python and the Turtle Library

## Purpose and Issues
A slightly more complex game seemed necessary after the CLI Tik Tak Toe I made, so as one of the first video games Pong seemed like a good step. 

The AI is currently impossible to beat, it can move in finite jumps but can do those jumps infinitly quickly, so the paddle will always be exactly where it needs to hit the ball. 

The game also performs poorly on my machine with the ball moving at jittery speeds. I am currently unsure how to optimize this.

## Looking Forward:
Improving the AI by giving it a variable dy value rather than jumps of pixels could make it more realistic and possible to beat

Updating the game field to look more interesting will make the game look more polished and engaging

Researching process optimization will hopefully lead me to a more smooth and seamless game experience

Introduce angle changes based on where the ball touches the paddle and different trajectories at the start of each round so games are not as repetitve and predictable
